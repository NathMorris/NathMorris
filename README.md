Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here‚Äôs a bit about me:

## About Me

I'm a seasoned technical engineer with a diverse background and a passion for land investment. With 10 years of experience in commercial nuclear power and software verification & validation, and 6 years in flight simulation, I've honed my skills in developing efficient, software-based systems. 

For the last 5 years, I've been a full-time land investor, leveraging over 20 years of experience in investing in single-family and residential multifamily properties. My heart lies with vacant land investments, which I find incredibly rewarding and exciting.
